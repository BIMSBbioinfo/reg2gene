This repo contains the code for predicting the target genes for regulatory elements

It contains the following:

-  regulatory activity quantification per pre-defined region (regulatoryActivity)
    - the code base that is used to quantify enhancer activties across different markers and studies
    - The scripts to match enhancers to potential target genes within pre-defined window around gene TSSes
- enhancer target prediction (targetPrediction)
    - This should contain the code for target prediction methods
- performance metrics (performance):
    - should contain the code for performance metrics.
