Description: reg2gene R package was build to perform 2 main categories of tasks:
  -   1.  to predict target genes for regulatory elements genome-wide by 
  building "gene expression - enhancer activity" models by performing:
  -   DATA INTEGRATION - extracting information stored in bigWig files
  (across  different cell types) to
  -   a. quantifying (enhancer) activity (regulatory potential) for genomic 
  regions of interest (enhancer regions), and
  -   b. quantifying gene expression for genes of interest, and/or
  -   c. combining these informations into one object used further for
  modelling
  -   DATA MODELLING (including performance assessment) - modelling gene 
  expression - enhancer activity using different algorithms, and combine 
  different models with meta-analysis and voting procedure. 
  Additionally, one can benchmark results and obtain confusion matrix.
  -   DATA VISUALIZATION - visualization of interactions as loops in the
  context of the genome
  -   2. to annotate genomic regions (ChIP-Seq peaks or similar regions in the
  genome) to genes they are associated with based on the modelled enhancer-gene 
  associations. Optionally one can as well associate genes with diseases 
  reported in the disease-gene databases.
