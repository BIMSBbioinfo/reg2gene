This repo contains the code for predicting the target genes for regulatory elements

Ideally it should contain the following:
-  regulatory activity quantification per pre-defined region (regulatoryActivity)
  - the code base that is used to quantify enhancer activties across different markers and studies
  - The scripts to match enhancers to potential target genes within pre-defined window around gene TSSes
- enhancer target prediction (targetPrediction)
  - This should contain the code for target prediction methods
- performance metrics (performance):
  - should contain the code for performance metrics.
