\title{Benchmarks interactions reg2gene models using benchmark data}
\usage{
benchmarkInteractions(interactions, benchInteractions, preFilter = FALSE,
  binary = FALSE, forceByName = FALSE, mc.cores = 1,
  ignore.strand = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{interactions}{a \code{\link[InteractionSet]{GInteractions}} object 
output from \code{\link{associateReg2Gene}}). 
Usually, 1st GRanges object, or anchor1
corresponds to the enahncer location, whereas the other GRanges object 
corresponds to the regulatory region locations.}

\item{benchInteractions}{a \code{\link[InteractionSet]{GInteractions}} object output
from \code{\link{associateReg2Gene}}) or a list of GInteractions object. 
Both regions are used in the benchmarking procedure. 
This object stores benchmarking informations eg interacting region
coordinates from techniques such as HiC,eQTL studies...}

\item{preFilter}{(def:FALSE).  If TRUE, additional columns are added to the
input interactions object (additionally to the Bench column that is reported
by default) that
store info whether tested regions have any potential to be benchmarked.
Meaning, if all regulatory region-TSS pairs [anchor1 and anchor2 from
interactions] do not overlap with any benchmark anchor1 or anchor2 location 
they will be reported to be 0 (or no potential to be benchmarked at all), 
otherwise it is 1 (possible to be benchmarked).E.g. it selects interactions 
regions only when both regulatory region and TSS  have overlapping regions 
somewhere in the benchmarking set; across all benchmark anchor pairs, but 
not necessarily overlapping regions of the same benchmark pair.
This info is
important to a priori remove high number of true negatives in 
regulatoryReg-TSS pairs, before running \code{\link{confusionMatrix}} since
TN are very abundant in the interactions dataset since benchmark dataset 
usually covers much smaller regions of the genome (method limitations)}

\item{binary}{(def:FALSE) how many times reg2Gene interactions is observed in
the benchmark dataset(s). If TRUE, reports if overlap with benchmark dataset 
is observed at least once).}

\item{forceByName}{(def:FALSE) force benchmark data to have an equal gene 
coordinates as interactions if gene names overlap. IMPORTANT! Gene
coordinates are necessarilly a second anchor of the input interactions and 
benchInteractions objects,and column with gene names needs to be called "name".}

\item{mc.cores}{possible to be runned in parallel. Argument for mclapply f();
how many cores to use.}

\item{ignore.strand}{argument to be passed to
\code{\link[IRanges]{findOverlaps}}. When set to TRUE, the strand 
information is ignored in the overlap analysis.}

\item{...}{further arguments to methods, not implemented yet}
}
\value{
GInteractions object with added benchmark results metadata [Bench 
column].Each column metadata column corresponds to one benchmark dataset 
analyzed if input is list() 
Values can be either 0/1 (not/benchmarked) or 0-n (how many times each 
gene-enhancer pair is benchmared).
}
\description{
The function that takes as input results of \code{\link{associateReg2Gene}} 
or any other modelling procedure implemente in \code{reg2gene} package,
and predefined benchmark dataset as 
\code{\link[InteractionSet]{GInteractions}} object.
This function adds a metadata column with info about benchmarking success -
whether tested regions are benchmarked or not.  
By default it reportes how many times interactions is observed in the 
benchmark dataset. If binary is set to TRUE, then vector of 0' and 1's is 
reported (1 - overlapping benchmark dataset at least once) and 0 (not
overlapping benchmark dataset at all).
}
\details{
GInteractions objects - an output of \code{\link{associateReg2Gene}}
[or a list of such objects] and benchmark dataset are overlaped. 
\code{\link[InteractionSet]{linkOverlaps}} between interactions 
and benchmark object is performed, and for each input pair it is reported 
whether this pair is benchmarked or not,and how many times (if binary=F).
Criss-cross overlap of interacting regions is performed; thus is anchor1 from
benchmark dataset is overlapping anchor2 from tested dataset, than anchor2
from benchmark dataset needs to overlap anchor1 from tested datased, or
vice-versa. 

Additionally, details for preFilter option:
All benchmark regions that can be confirmed by any combination of 
enh/gene pairs [anchor1 or anchor2 form interactions object] is obtained. 
Then
selected unique union of anchor1 or anchor2 form interactions object is used
as anchor1-anchor2 pairs that can be benchmarked. Reasoning, if present in
this set anchor1 or anchor2 regions form interactions object necessarily need
to have other member of the pair overlapping somewhere in benchmark dataset.
