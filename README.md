# enhancers2genes
This repo contains the code for predicting the target genes for enhancers

Ideally it should contain the following:
- enhancer activity quantification (enhancerActivity)
  - the code base that is used to quantify enhancer activties across different markers and studies
  - The scripts to match enhancers to potential target genes within pre-defined window around gene TSSes
- enhancer target prediction (targetPrediction)
  - This should contain the code for target prediction methods
- performance metrics (performance):
  - should contain the code for performance
